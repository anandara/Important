There are two files in the folder:
http-statuscode-master.txt - for lookup http request info
prod_nginx_live_only_log - server log


Server log File Format:
$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" $status
$body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"

Format Description:
    $remote_addr – IP from which request was made
    $remote_user – HTTP Authenticated User. This will be blank for
most apps as modern apps do not use HTTP-based authentication.
    [$time_local] – timestamp as per server timezone
    “$request” – HTTP request type GET, POST, etc + requested path
without args + HTTP protocol version
    $status – HTTP response code from server
    $body_bytes_sent – size of server response in bytes
    “$http_referer” – Referral URL (if present)
    “$http_user_agent” – User agent as seen by server
